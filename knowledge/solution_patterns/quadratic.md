# Quadratic Equation Solution Pattern

Standard form: ax² + bx + c = 0

Step-by-step approach:

1. Identify a, b, c
2. Calculate discriminant D = b² - 4ac
3. Case analysis:
   - D > 0 → two distinct real roots
   - D = 0 → one real root (repeated)
   - D < 0 → no real roots (complex)
4. Roots = [-b ± √D] / (2a)
5. If asked for sum/product:
   - Sum of roots = -b/a
   - Product of roots = c/a

Common variations:
- ax² + bx + c = k → move k to left → ax² + bx + (c-k) = 0
- Word problems → form equation carefully
